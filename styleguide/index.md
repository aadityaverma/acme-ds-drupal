# This is an example of the Acme Design System Style Guide using Emulsify.

It is generated using <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mdx-js/specification">MDX</a>, and <a href="https://theme-ui.com/">Theme UI</a>.

Note:
- This is the default look and feel. We would of course style this artefact to align to the Acme brand. Here is <a href="https://western-identity.emulsify.info/0-overview/0-welcome/" target="_blank">an example</a> of a slightly customised theme.
- The Components section would be generated from the components directory. This
  linkage is still being tested. For now a simple example component is shown.
